•The main goal is to make the machine smartly recommends movies to the users in their own language. 
•Develop a model to process and understand text in multiple languages.  
•To entertain users.


 #### Major Problem:
•Solved one of the NLP challenges which is the machine’s grasping of the human text (especialy when it is Arabic)
•In Arabia and India there are few people who don’t know English, so for those people it will be difficult to use the chatbots for any kind of help. Building a chatbot in their known language will be helpful to all of them. 
 Types of Recommendation System:
**•Contextual Type:** make use of varied inputs to make sure that recommendations are smarter. They include keywords and other forms of input to filter and rank recommendations. 
**•Collaborative Filtering-based type:** this type of recommendation system takes data from several different users and learns how to predict what someone might like based on search and choice similarity like looking at people who have the same taste.

 A. Arabic Movies Data: Contains information on more than 1200 movies such as release date, genres, and cast …etc

2- Web Scraping: 
 A. Movies Data pulled from Wikipedia Platform: Contains about 400 movies and their information. 

####  Strargy:
